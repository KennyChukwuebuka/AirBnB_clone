0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

AirBnB is a website that allows people to book a room, an apartmen or a location, etc, for private events and stays of choice from individuals/corporation. This project seeks to make a clone of this website.

In order to make a functional website, a console is needed. This will provide us to perform various tasks and operations related to the AirBnB platform without the need for a graphical user interface (GUI), which will enable us to:

    Administrative Control: The console provides administrative control over the website's functionalities. It allows authorized users to manage and oversee various aspects of the platform, such as user accounts, property listings, bookings, and reviews.

    Efficiency: A console can be more efficient for developers and administrators when performing tasks like data management, testing, debugging, and maintenance. It allows them to issue commands and execute scripts rapidly.

    Automation: The console can be used for automation. You can write scripts and commands to perform repetitive tasks, such as importing data, generating reports, or updating property information. This automation can save time and reduce the risk of human errors.

    Testing and Debugging: Developers can use the console for testing features and debugging issues. It's a valuable tool for running unit tests, verifying functionality, and diagnosing problems in a controlled environment.

    Flexibility: A console provides flexibility for managing various aspects of the Airbnb website. You can add new features, configure settings, and perform custom tasks as needed.

    Security: By controlling access to the console, you can enhance the security of your website. Only authorized users should have access to it, and you can implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect sensitive operations.

For an Airbnb website, specific use cases for the console might include:

    User Management: Admins can create, update, or suspend user accounts, as well as manage user roles and permissions.

    Property Listings: They can add, modify, or remove property listings and set pricing details.

    Booking Management: Admins can oversee bookings, check availability, and resolve booking-related issues.

    Review and Rating Management: They can monitor and moderate user reviews and ratings to ensure a positive user experience.

    Reporting and Analytics: The console can generate reports and collect data for analytics and business insights.

The objectives for this project are:
=================================================================
    Creating a Python Package: By the end of the project, you should be able to create a Python package, which is a structured collection of modules that can be easily distributed and reused in various projects.

    Building a Command Interpreter: You will learn how to create a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module. This involves designing an interactive shell that allows users to enter commands and receive responses, similar to a command-line interface.

    Unit Testing in Large Projects: You will gain an understanding of unit testing and how to implement it effectively in a large Python project. This includes writing test cases to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code.

    Serialization and Deserialization: You will learn how to serialize and deserialize a class, which involves converting objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, and then reconstructing those objects from the stored data.

    Working with JSON Files: You will acquire the skills to write and read JSON files, a common data interchange format. This knowledge is valuable for data storage and exchange between different systems.

    Managing Datetime: You will learn how to work with datetime objects, which are essential for handling dates and times in Python. This includes parsing, formatting, and performing operations with datetime values.

    Understanding UUID: You will gain knowledge about UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) and their use in generating unique identifiers that are highly unlikely to clash with other generated identifiers.

    ***args and kwargs: You will understand the concepts of *args and **kwargs, which allow you to pass a variable number of non-keyword and keyword arguments to functions, respectively. This enables flexible and dynamic function parameter handling.

    Handling Named Arguments: You will learn how to handle named arguments in a function, which provides a way to pass arguments in a clear and readable manner, making your code more maintainable and self-documenting.

Description of the Console:

##BaseModel##
========================================================================

1. **Constructor (`__init__`):** The constructor initializes the instance attributes. It accepts optional arguments `*args` and `**kwargs` for flexibility when creating instances. If `kwargs` is provided, it populates the attributes from the dictionary. If not, it generates a new `id` using `uuid.uuid4()`, sets `created_at` and `updated_at` to the current datetime, and adds the instance to the storage.

2. **`__str__` Method:** This method provides a string representation of the object, following the specified format "[class name] (id) {attribute_dict}".

3. **`save` Method:** The `save` method updates the `updated_at` attribute with the current datetime and then calls the `storage.save()` method to persist the changes.

4. **`to_dict` Method:** This method converts the instance to a dictionary, including all attributes and their values. It also adds a `"__class__"` key with the class name, and converts `created_at` and `updated_at` to ISO format.

Overall, your implementation adheres to the requirements and should serve as a solid foundation for creating other classes in your project, such as property listings or user accounts, by inheriting from this `BaseModel`. It provides common attributes and methods for serialization and data management.

##The Console##
========================================================================


The `console.py` script serves as a command-line interpreter for the Airbnb clone project. It provides several commands to create, manage, and retrieve instances of various classes within the project. Users can interact with the script by entering commands and arguments to perform tasks such as creating objects, displaying object information, updating attributes, and more.

**Examples of Outputs:**

Command List:

1.  `create <class name>`: Creates a new instance of the specified class, saves it to the JSON file, and displays its unique ID.

    Example: `create BaseModel`

2.  `show <class name> <id>`: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and ID.

    Example: `show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234`

3.  `destroy <class name> <id>`: Deletes an instance based on the class name and ID and saves the change in the JSON file.

    Example: `destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234`

4.  `all [class name]`: Prints all string representations of instances based on the class name. If no class name is specified, it lists all instances from different classes.

    Example: `all BaseModel` or `all`

5.  `count <class name>`: Counts the number of instances of a specific class.

    Example: `count BaseModel`

6.  `update <class name> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value>`: Updates an instance based on the class name and ID by adding or updating attributes. The attribute value is automatically casted to the appropriate data type if possible.

    Example: `update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "airbnb@mail.com"`

Special Considerations:

-  Double quotes should be used for attribute values containing spaces.
-  The script provides informative error messages for missing class names, non-existent classes, missing instance IDs, and no instance found for the given parameters.

Usage:

To use the `console.py` script, run it in your terminal. You'll be greeted with the prompt `(hbnb)`, where you can enter the above-listed commands to interact with the Airbnb clone project's data.

Exiting the Console:

    To exit the console, use the `quit` command or press `Ctrl+D` to send an EOF (End Of File) character.

The `console.py` script simplifies the management of the Airbnb clone project's data and allows for easy testing and manipulation of instances.
